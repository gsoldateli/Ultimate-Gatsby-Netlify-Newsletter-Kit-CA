    # Why do we use it?


    It is a ***long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
    readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
    Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
    opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
    English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page*** editors now use
    Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
    uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
    over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes o*n purpose (injected
    humour and the like).


    ## <a href="#">Where does it come from?</a>


    > Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
    2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
    comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
    treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
    first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
    in section 1.10.32.


    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
    for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum
    et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
    accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
