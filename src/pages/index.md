    #### The definitive solution depends on a revolutionary movement—your active
    participation


    Our entire movement and all of our technologies are based on our innovation
    called **Information-Knowledge Theory,** which is a comprehensive,
    multidisciplinary solution that empowers the unprosperous themselves with
    the necessary knowledge, resources, and advantages for realizing
    prosperity—self-actualization and well-being. See the section below for
    more.

    — Because politicians have proven they cannot solve the massive income and
    wealth inequality and the academic achievement gap; nor can they help the
    unprosperous realize their potential and well-being
  title: Why are *you* crucial to the success of the unprosperous?

    Information-Knowledge Theory, created by AI Humanity's founder Richard
    Bovell, is a comprehensive philosophy that specifies two overarching
    principles to solve complex, elusive problems such as global poverty,
    generational underachievement, and the realization of widespread prosperity:


    1. Use an interdisciplinary (economics, psychology, philosophy, history,
    *and* anthropology, for example) investigation to thoroughly understand the
    problem under consideration.


    2. Use omniscient knowledge (derived from the interdisciplinary
    investigation noted above) to devise effective, requisite solutions that
    endure. For a detailed explanation of these principles, see our
    [Information-Knowledge Theory page]().


    The list of integrated programs below, which make up AI Humanity's core
    solution, is the embodiment of Information-Knowledge Theory to solve some of
    the major problems we described earlier on this page, including poverty,
    academic underachievement, and unprosperousness. These integrated
    programs—the core of our solution—follow:

        To properly resolve generational poverty, enduring academic
        underachievement, widespread economic hardship, and a lack of well-being
        and life satisfaction (all highly complex endeavors that politicians and
        lawmakers can't resolve), we need a collective effort—a transformative
        movement that exploits our best technological resources and capitalizes
        on the omniscient knowledge available to us. Our Collective Intelligence
        program does exactly those things.




        This program allows you, along with others, to make small but notable
        individual contributions (for example, by adding resources to the
        Rewarding Careers and All Aid programs described below, in a manner
        similar to contributing to Wikipedia's content) so that, together, we
        can help the unprosperous (including you, if necessary) with *all* the
        resources, tools, and advantages necessary to overcome the seemingly
        insurmountable barriers to prosperity. [Learn more](<>) about Collective
        Intelligence.

        This program provides a comprehensive assessment of the well-being,
        social and civic status and liberties, economic standing, personal
        edification, and much more of the unprosperous, and it monitors all of
        these things to ensure the unprosperous get on the path to prosperity
        and successfully realize that prosperity. The program also provides a
        similar comprehensive assessment and monitoring for communities.


        In short, Prosperity Score tells us everything each individual person
        (and their community) need to become prosperous and allows us to provide
        them those needs and keep them on track to prosperity. [Learn more]()

        Whatever the pressing need of the unprosperous (tuition for
        self-advancement, drug-addiction or mental health treatment, food,
        childcare, housing, etc.), we help the unprosperous get all the
        resources in a coordinated manner to ensure the individual is on the
        path to self-sufficiency and won't need recurring aid. Summarily, we
        provide aid where it is needed (by collaborating will all aid
        organizations and local and state governments around the world), and,
        crucially, we use that aid to ensure the unprosperous become
        self-sufficient and get on the path to prosperity. Learn more]() about
        Collective Intelligence. [Learn more]().

        This program helps the unprosperous (and indeed, anymore) fine the most
        ideal career that aligns with their passions, interest, and capacity.
        "Rewarding," in this context, refers to careers that have a bright
        future, provide excellent benefits, allow for self-actualization, and
        pay at least a middle-income salary. [Learn more]().

        Economics, financial, and language literacy; a thirst for knowledge and
        personal advancement; a strong sense of purpose and agency; and a
        yearning for self-actualization and well-being remain the preeminent
        virtues for flourishing as an individual. Through our Personal
        Cultivation program, we help the unprosperous with all the resources to
        cultivate and advance themselves.
